Imagine you are working as a data analyst in a company. The HR department stores all employee details in a table called employee_demographics. This table has separate columns for first_name and last_name.

One day, your manager asks you to prepare a report where employeesâ€™ full names are displayed in a single column instead of two separate ones.

This way, instead of manually combining names in a spreadsheet or application, the database itself provides a clean, formatted full_name column.
